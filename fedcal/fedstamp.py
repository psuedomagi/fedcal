    `FedStamp` extends `pd.Timestamp` for fedcal functionality.
    Supports all functionalities of pandas' pd.Timestamp
    objects, while adding specific features for the fedcal.

    Attributes
    ----------
    ts : the `pd.Timestamp` object that forms the backbone of the
    instance. If a ts is not provided at instantiations, the
    instance will default to the current date (datetime.now()). Note: we
    use ts as an attribute name to avoid overwriting Timestamp.
    timestamp().

    _status_cache : A *private* lazy attribute that caches StatusDictType
    dictionary (Dict[Dept, FedDepartment]) from _dept_status.
    DepartmentState for the date for supplying status-related properties.
    Provided by _get_status_cache() and _set_status_cache() private
    methods.

    _holidays: A *private* lazy attribute that caches our FedHolidays
    instance once called.

    _fiscalcal: A *private* lazy attribute that caches our FiscalCalendar
    instance once called.

    year_month_day
        returns the FedStamp as a YearMonthDay object.

    posix_day
        Returns the POSIX-day timestamp normalized to midnight.

    business_day
        Checks if the date is a business day.

    holiday
        Checks if the date is a federal holiday.

    proclamation_holiday
        Checks if the date was a proclaimed holiday (i.e. a one-off holiday
        proclaimed by executive order).

    possible_proclamation_holiday
        Guesses (I take no further ownership of the result) if the future date
        will likely to be a proclaimed holiday.

    probable_military_passday
        Estimates if the date is likely a military pass day. Actual
        passdays vary across commands and locations, but this should
        return a result that's correct in the majority of cases.

    mil_payday
        Checks if the date is a military payday.

    civ_payday
        Checks if the date is a civilian payday.

    fq
        Retrieves the [Federal] fiscal quarter of the timestamp as 1-digit
        integer

    fy
        Retrieves the [Federal] fiscal year of the timestamp as 4-digit
        integer/

    fy_fq
        Retrieves the [Federal] fiscal year and fiscal quarter of the
        timestamp as a string in format 'YYYYQ#'.

    is_ffq_start
        Returns True if the Timestamp represents the first day of a fiscal
        quarter

    is_ffq_end
        Returns True if the Timestamp represents the last day of a fiscal
        quarter

    is_fy_start
        Returns True if the Timestamp represents the first day of a
        fiscal year

    is_fy_end
        Returns True if the Timestamp represents the last day of a
        fiscal year

    departments
        Retrieves the set of executive departments active on the date, as
        Dept enum objects.

    all_depts_status
        Retrieves the status of all departments as a dictionary on the
        date.

    all_depts_full_approps
        Checks if all departments are fully appropriated on the date,
        returning bool.

    all_depts_cr
        Checks if all departments were/are under a continuing resolution on
        the date, returning bool.

    all_depts_funded
        Checks if all departments were/are either fully appropriated or
        under a continuing resolution on the date, returning bool.

    all_unfunded
        Checks if all departments were/are unfunded on the date (either
        shutdown or otherwise gapped), returning bool.

    gov_cr
        Checks if the date was during a continuing resolution (can include
        near-future dates since we know CR expiration dates at the time
        they are passed), returning bool any departments were under a CR.

    gov_shutdown
        Checks if the date was/is during a shutdown, returning bool if any
        departments were shutdown.

    gov_approps_gap
        Checks if the date was/is during an appropriations gap, returning
        bool if any department had a gap in funding.

    gov_approps_gap
        Check if the date was/is during a funding gap (appropriations gap
        or shutdown), returning bool if any department was shutdown or
        had an appropriations gap

    full_op_depts
        Retrieves departments that were fully operational (had a full-year
        appropriation) on the date, returning a dict.

    funded_depts
        Retrieves departments that were/are either fully operational or
        under a continuing resolution on the date, returning a dict.

    cr_depts
        Retrieves departments that were/are under a continuing resolution
        on the date, returning a dict. Current data are from FY99 to
        present. As discussed above for cr, these can include near future
        dates.

    gapped_depts
        Retrieves departments that were/are in an appropriations gap on the
        date but not shutdown, returning a dict. Notably, these are
        isolated to the 1970s and early 80s.

    shutdown_depts
        Retrieves departments that were/are shut down on the date. Data
        available from FY75 to present.

    unfunded_depts

        Dept enum objects.

    dict_to_feddept_list(status_dict)
        Utility method that converts a status dictionary (which most of the

        for status-related property methods.
