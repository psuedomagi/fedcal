    Dept enums represent federal departments and are used throughout fedcal to

    Methods
    ----------
    reverse_lookup(cls, lookup_attr: str | int) -> EnumType:
        inherited from EnumBase. Allows reverse_lookup of enum members from
        their attributes.
        Example:
            ```python
            DeptStatus.reverse_lookup(3) # or "open, unknown capacity", etc
            >> DeptStatus.ND

    swap_attrs(cls, swap_attr: str, new_value: str) -> EnumType:)
        A shortcut method that uses reverse_lookup to swap attributes for a
        member. You give it one attribute representation of a member and it
        gives you another (you provide the desired new attribute as a string)
        Example:
            ```python
            Dept.Status.swap_attrs("appropriated", "val")
            >> 4
